Based on the data in purchase_data.csv, several conclusions can be drawn from analyzing the data.

1)The most popular items and the most profitable items are dominated by higher-priced items. These items have individual prices that are much higher than the average purchase price for each person. 

2)Players seem to be satisfied with a small number of purchases. Out of 576 total players, only 18 made more than 2 purchases.

3) 83% of the revenue generated from item sales comes from males, and 47% of the revenue comes from the age group 20-24. This is the main target demographic for sales.
